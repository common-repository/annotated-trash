Why is that comment in the trash? If you co-blog, you've probably asked this. The Annotated Trash plugin helps answer that question.

Co-Blogging is fun, until someone loses a comment to someone else's mouseclick. Communicate the reason that comment is in the trash by adding annotating it!

This module adds a new column to the comments table in which you can enter your reason.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the annotatedtrash tar.gz or zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip or tar xfz it.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
